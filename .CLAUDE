# Project Context for AI Assistants

## Project Overview
This is a personal portfolio website with blog functionality built using Gatsby and React.

## Current State
- **Framework**: Gatsby (React-based static site generator)
- **Styling**: styled-components with reactstrap (Bootstrap)
- **TypeScript**: Recently implemented - types are not fully added to all components yet
- **Content**: Portfolio projects with image galleries, blog posts, skills, contact info

## Migration Goals

### Primary Goal: Migrate from Gatsby to Astro
We are **aiming to make net-negative changes** (simplify the codebase) to eventually convert this site to use Astro instead of Gatsby.

**Why Astro?**
- Better performance with islands architecture
- Less JavaScript shipped to the client
- Simpler build process
- Better TypeScript support out of the box
- More flexible content handling

**Migration Strategy**:
- Prefer simpler, more portable solutions when fixing or adding features
- Avoid adding complex Gatsby-specific dependencies
- Keep components as vanilla React as possible
- Document any Gatsby-specific features that will need replacement

## Code Quality Guidelines

### TypeScript
- TypeScript was recently implemented
- **Action Required**: Add proper types and interfaces to components when working on them
- Convert `any` types to proper interfaces
- Add return types to functions
- Use proper typing for props, state, and component definitions

### Simplification Principles
1. **Net-negative changes**: When fixing bugs or adding features, try to remove more code than you add
2. **Reduce dependencies**: Prefer standard React patterns over library-specific solutions
3. **Avoid over-engineering**: Keep solutions simple and maintainable
4. **Framework-agnostic**: Write code that will be easier to migrate to Astro

### Component Structure
- Functional components preferred (already in use)
- Use React hooks for state management
- Keep styled-components usage (works with Astro)
- Minimize Gatsby-specific APIs (GraphQL queries, gatsby-image, etc.)

## Current Technical Debt

### Known Issues
1. **Lightbox Library**: Using `react-image-lightbox` (archived since Jan 2023)
   - Ctrl+Zoom closes the lightbox (browser zoom interferes)
   - Need better zoom functionality
   - Consider simpler alternatives or native solutions

2. **TypeScript Coverage**: Not all components have proper types
   - Props often use `any` type
   - Missing interfaces for data structures
   - No return type annotations on many functions

3. **Gatsby-Specific Code**: Heavy reliance on Gatsby APIs
   - GraphQL queries for content
   - gatsby-plugin-image for image optimization
   - Gatsby routing and page generation

## Development Priorities

1. **Maintainability**: Choose solutions that are actively maintained
2. **Portability**: Prefer solutions that work outside Gatsby ecosystem
3. **Simplicity**: Less code is better code
4. **Type Safety**: Add TypeScript types when touching components
5. **Performance**: Keep bundle size small

## Working with This Codebase

### When Adding Features
- Check if a simpler solution exists before adding dependencies
- Consider how it will migrate to Astro
- Add TypeScript types
- Aim for net-negative code changes

### When Fixing Bugs
- Look for opportunities to simplify while fixing
- Remove unused code
- Add proper types
- Document any Gatsby-specific workarounds

### When Reviewing Dependencies
- Check if dependency is actively maintained
- Consider if it's needed or if native browser APIs suffice
- Prefer framework-agnostic libraries
- Document alternatives for future migration
