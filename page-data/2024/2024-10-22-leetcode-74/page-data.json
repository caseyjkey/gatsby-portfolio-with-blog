I admitted that I have only used it once before. and it has been many years since then.\nHowever, I used AWS CDK frequently at my last job with Amazon. I hope that experience will help me learn Terraform.\nI'm going to write about my learning process for Terraform before my next interview sometime within the next week.\n\n# Learning Terraform\n\n## Initial Research\nAfter installing Terraform within WSL, I started the [Terraform Tutorial for AWS](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started).\nI'm going to follow this tutorial to learn the basics of Terraform, focusing on adding AWS resources as this is mentioned in Glassdoor interviews.\n\n## First Impressions\nThe Terraform CLI is easy to use. I made a `.tf` file and defined a Docker container and image.\nI ran `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply`.\nI'm impressed that Terraform created and ran a Docker container that quickly.\n\n## AWS\nNext, I created a new AWS account and configured the AWS CLI within WSL.\nI created a new `main.tf` file and added an AWS provider and EC2 instance resource.\n\n# Next Steps\n\nI plan on taking the Terraform Associate certification exam sometime in the next month.\nI'm going to study using the [Terraform Associate Certification Guide](https://www.terraform.io/docs/terraform-associate-certification-guide.pdf).\n\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/2024/2024-10-15-learning-terraform/index.mdx"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2024/2024-10-28-leetcode-12/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"LeetCode 12.
