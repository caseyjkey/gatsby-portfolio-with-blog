I admitted that I have only used it once before. and it has been many years since then.\r\nHowever, I used AWS CDK frequently at my last job with Amazon. I hope that experience will help me learn Terraform.\r\nI'm going to write about my learning process for Terraform before my next interview sometime within the next week.\r\n\r\n# Learning Terraform\r\n\r\n## Initial Research\r\nAfter installing Terraform within WSL, I started the [Terraform Tutorial for AWS](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started).\r\nI'm going to follow this tutorial to learn the basics of Terraform, focusing on adding AWS resources as this is mentioned in Glassdoor interviews.\r\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"C:/Users/Casey/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/2024/2024-10-13-email-processing-design/index.mdx"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Learning Terraform","date":"2024-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","published":true}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1824709836","2756050595","3405795015","4292178745"],"slicesMap":{}}
