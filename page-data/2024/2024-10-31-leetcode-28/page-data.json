I then worked through it with this naive solution.\n\n# Solution\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def convert(self, s: str, numRows: int) -> str:\n        grid = [['' for column in range(len(s))] for row in range(numRows)]\n        x, y = 0, 0\n        direction = 1\n        for char in s:\n            grid[y][x] = char\n            if y == numRows - 1:\n                direction = -1\n                x += 1\n            elif direction == -1 and y > 0:\n                x += 1\n            elif direction == -1 and y == 0:\n                direction = 1\n            y += direction if numRows > 1 else 0\n        result = \"\"\n        for row in grid:\n            for char in row:\n                if char:\n                    result += char\n        return result\n```\nO(n) = n*m or n^2\n\n## Reflection\nLooking back, I realized I didn't need to include the empty spaces as if it were illustrated. This allows me to simplify my code by using the append() method for lists.
