This will be a CRUD app for tracking and improving scholarship essays.\n\n___\n\n# App Idea\nI am creating this app to improve student's scholarship essays by improving their past submissions.\nThis app will allow students to upload their essays, and then use AI to improve them.\nI want to implement RAG to give context to essay prompts. \n\n___\n\n# Framework Choice\n\n___\n\n## Next.js vs Remix\nAt first, I wanted to use Next.js as my React framework since I used it while working with Amazon.\nHowever, I noticed that Next.js is more popular for its server-side rendering features.\nSince this will be a client-side app, I decided improved SEO through SSR is not needed for this app.\nSo, I decided to look into Remix. It looks great for building fast web apps with a focus on developer experience.\nI'm glad to have found a [great starter project](https://remix.run/resources/remix-blues-stack) integrating Postgres for the database, Cypress for testing, and a full CI/CD workflow through Github Actions.\nHowever, I feel like I am losing experience from setting all these features up from scratch. Hopefully the benefits of each component become apparent once I begin implementing my scholarship app.\n\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/blog/2024/2024-10-08-scholarships-plus/index.mdx"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2024/2024-10-15-learning-terraform/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Learning Terraform","date":"October 15, 2024"},"body":"\nThe intial phone screen for the StubHub interview went well.\nI was asked about my experience with Terraform. I admitted that I have only used it once before. and it has been many years since then.\nHowever, I used AWS CDK frequently at my last job with Amazon. I hope that experience will help me learn Terraform.\nI'm going to write about my learning process for Terraform before my next interview sometime within the next week.\n\n___\n\n# Learning Terraform\n\n___\n\n## Initial Research\nAfter installing Terraform within WSL, I started the [Terraform Tutorial for AWS](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started).\nI'm going to follow this tutorial to learn the basics of Terraform, focusing on adding AWS resources as this is mentioned in Glassdoor interviews.\n\n___\n\n## First Impressions\nThe Terraform CLI is easy to use. I made a `.tf` file and defined a Docker container and image.\nI ran `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply`.\nI'm impressed that Terraform created and ran a Docker container that quickly.\n\n___\n\n## AWS\nNext, I created a new AWS account and configured the AWS CLI within WSL.\nI created a new `main.tf` file and added an AWS provider and EC2 instance resource.\n\n___\n\n# Next Steps\n\nI plan on taking the Terraform Associate certification exam sometime in the next month.\nI'm going to study using the [Terraform Associate Certification Guide](https://www.terraform.io/docs/terraform-associate-certification-guide.pdf).\n\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/blog/2024/2024-10-15-learning-terraform/index.mdx"}},"post":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2024/2024-10-13-email-processing-design/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Email Processing System Design","date":"October 13, 2024"},"body":"\nI'm looking forward to an interview for a software engineer position at StubHub.\nIt offers work with microservices, kubernetes, and cloud-native technologies.\nThe position focuses on DevOps, such as infrastructure, build, deployment, and artifact management.\nI'm excited because my current experience aligns with the position's focus. \nThis will be an improvement for my career as it offers better compensation and location (Santa Monica!).\n\n___\n\n# Interview Prep\nI checked Glassdoor, and it sounds like the technical interview question will be easier than Google was.\nIt will likely be a LeetCode medium or easy question, but there was mention of a system design question.\nSeveral people said they were asked to design an email processing system.\nSo, I want to write about how I would design such a system.\n\n___\n\n# System Design\n\n___\n\n## System Components\n\n___\n\n### Email Receiving\nEmails will be received through an API provided by the email hosting service.\nThe API will have a `/send` endpoint that the email provider can call to send an email to a user.\nThe API will have a `/receive` endpoint that the email provider can call to receive an email at a specific address.\n\n___\n\n### Email Parsing\nOnce an email is received, it needs to be parsed.\nThe content and metadata needs to be extracted.\nThe content needs to be converted to a format that can be processed by the system.\nThis would likely be a JSON blog format to be stored in a database.\n\n___\n\n### Email Classification\nEmails need to be categorized, at the least by their sender and receiver.\nThis will allow for the user and administrator to view their sent and received emails.\n\n___\n\n### Email Routing\nEmails need to be routed to the correct user.\nThis will allow for the user to view their emails.\nThis will be done by using their email address to look up the user ID in the database..\nThen, the email's content which was stored earlier will have its ID added to the user's received emails.\nThis could be stored as a one-to-many relationship.\n\n___\n\n### Email Storage\nEmails need to be stored in a database.\nThe database will need to be able to store the email's content, metadata, and tags.\nSince this data is structured, it is a good fit for a structured SQL database like Postgres.\n\n___\n\n### Email Client\nEmails can be exposed to the user in their client.\nTo do this, the data must be exposed through an API.\nThis will follow an email protocol such as SMTP, POP, or IMAP.\nWe follow the common protocols so the the user can use any email client to access their emails.\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/blog/2024/2024-10-13-email-processing-design/index.mdx"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Email Processing System Design","date":"2024-10-13T00:00:00.000Z","published":true}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
