This allows me to simplify my code by using the append() method for lists. Here is my improved version:\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def convert(self, s: str, numRows: int) -> str:\n        if numRows == 1 or numRows >= len(s):\n            return s\n\n        grid = [[] for _ in range(numRows)]\n        y = 0 \n        direction = 1\n        for char in s:\n            grid[y].append(char)\n            if y == numRows - 1:\n                direction = -1\n            elif y == 0:\n                direction = 1\n            y += direction\n        \n        for i in range(len(grid)):\n            grid[i] = ''.join(grid[i])\n        result = ''.join(grid)\n        return result\n```\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/blog/2024/2024-10-30-leetcode-6/index.mdx"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"LeetCode 6.
