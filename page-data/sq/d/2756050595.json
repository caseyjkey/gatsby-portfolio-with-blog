{"data":{"about":{"bio":"I am driven by the intersection of AI, security, and scalable engineering because I see the potential for these technologies to create lasting societal impact. My focus is on building high-level systems that matter. Beyond the code, I want to give back by providing jobs, scholarships, and education to those coming up behind me. <br /><br /> When I am not working, I am usually skateboarding, heading to the beach, or tuning cars and sound systems. I'm always down to talk tech or hear about what you're building.","activities":[{"activity":{"description":"Comp.
