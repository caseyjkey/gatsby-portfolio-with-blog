{"data":{"about":{"bio":"The potential effect of technology on society thrills me! My dream is to travel the world as a tech entrepreneur. My focus will be in cybersecurity, teaching, and apps for education, finance, and music. After starting successful businesses, I want to give back by providing jobs, scholarships, and education with a focus on at-risk youth. <br /><br /> When I'm not coding, I enjoy skateboarding, sports, car tuning, and building sound systems. I'm happy to help anyone learn more about technology.","activities":[{"activity":{"description":"CS for AI @ USC, SoCal","icon":{"name":"GiBackpack","type":"gi"}}},{"activity":{"description":"<i>The Zero Percent</i> by D'Vaul Dey","icon":{"name":"FiBookOpen","type":"fi"}}},{"activity":{"description":"\"The Hills (Bass Boosted)\" - The Weeknd, Eminem","icon":{"name":"FiMusic","type":"fi"}}},{"activity":{"description":"Working as a Software Engineer for Amazon's World-Wide Finance Operations.","icon":{"name":"FaLaptopCode","type":"fa"}}}]}}}
