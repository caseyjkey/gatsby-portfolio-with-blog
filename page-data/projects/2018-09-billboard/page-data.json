To teach high school students with no programming experience, I developed a curriculum and hosted it as a blog.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nThe blog was hosted on Namecheap with a custom domain. Content was created and managed using Wordpress. Features were extended using PHP and plugins to provide social functions such as profiles and commenting.\n\n## Curriculum Content\n\nOn this blog, I posted lessons as blog posts including videos for:\n\n- Setting up the environment\n- Using variables\n- Control flow\n- Methods\n- Classes and using objects\n- Creating games using modules\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- WordPress\n- PHP\n- Python\n- Game Development\n\n## Impact & Recognition\n\nI discovered an unexpected love for teaching when I received my award. When I went up to the stage for recognition as an instructor, my students all cheered for me. This success has motivated me to keep curriculum development on my mind ever since.\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2018-05-whatspython/index.mdx"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2018-12-uxportfolio/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Innovative UI/UX Portfolio","date":"December 1, 2018"},"body":"\n**Web Development** | December 2018 - January 2019\n\n## Overview\n\nThis portfolio website serves as an interactive experience for viewing projects. My favorite challenges for this project were designing the page in Photoshop, exporting the images for responsive layouts, and adding interactivity using jQuery.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- Photoshop\n- JavaScript\n- jQuery\n- Bootstrap\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\nTo extend this project, I would like to connect the project's from my current portfolio into this portfolio; this would allow me to update both websites from the same content management system! Also, I would like to add more features to enhance the experience on mobile devices.\n\n## Links\n\n[View Live Site](https://caseyjkey.github.io/portfolio/)\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2018-12-uxportfolio/index.mdx"}},"post":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2018-09-billboard/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Music Billboard","date":"September 1, 2018"},"body":"\n**Blockchain Development** | September 2018 - September 2020\n\n## Overview\n\nFor the 2018 WyoHackathon, I wanted to extend EtherRadio. Motivated to recognize musicians for their work and spearhead SingularDTV's (now Breaker) challenge, I won myself and a friend on the idea of developing a top musician billboard powered by blockchain.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThis music billboard is a curated list of high-quality musicians. It works like a game where token holders control which musicians are listed. Applying to be on the top musician list requires a deposit to prevent trolls and spam submissions. The token holders are incentivized to maintain the quality of the list by challenging applications. If a challenge is successful, the voters are rewarded with the applicant's deposit.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- React\n- Ethereum\n- Bootstrap\n- GitHub\n- Firebase\n- Heroku\n\n## Achievement\n\nThe result of over 40 hours of hacking, my team created a billboard which impressed SingularDTV's team. We won an all expense paid trip to San Francisco, CA, to attend Our Music Festival. Our Music Festival was inspirational to attend as it was the world's first blockchain music festival.\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2018-09-billboard/index.mdx"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Music Billboard","date":"2018-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","published":true}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
