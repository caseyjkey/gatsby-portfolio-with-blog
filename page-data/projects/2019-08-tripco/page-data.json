Compared to previous portfolios, this application is a single page with a focus on easily updating and adding content.\n\n## Development Process\n\nTo accomplish this task, I converted a static page into a React project. The most difficult parts of this project were styling and evaluating my skills numerically.\n\n## Content Management\n\nTo make this website easier to update, I decided to use Gatsby to allow content creation via a dashboard. Finally, I am most proud of the administrator dashboard where I can modify the look and content without diving into code.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- React\n- npm\n- Git & GitHub\n- Sass\n- Gatsby\n\n## Links\n\n[View on GitHub](https://github.com/caseyjkey/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog)\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2020-01-portfolio/index.mdx"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2020-05-workspaces/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"WorkSpace Self-Service Portal","date":"September 1, 2020"},"body":"\n**Amazon Web Services Internship** | May 2020 - August 2020\n\n## Key Achievements\n\n- Architected a React web application to enable remote work by reducing end-user's procurement time by 85%\n- Satisfied customer requests for highly available RESTful services after project demos\n- Integrated with existing smart card authentication by creating an identity provider\n- Reduced administrator overhead by integrating with customer's existing Active Directory\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- AWS\n- React\n- Python\n- Git\n- Windows\n- macOS\n\n## Impact\n\nThis self-service portal significantly improved the efficiency of workspace provisioning, enabling remote workers to quickly access the resources they needed during a critical time.\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2020-05-workspaces/index.mdx"}},"post":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2019-08-tripco/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Brewery Trip Planner","date":"January 1, 2020"},"body":"\n**Software Engineering** | August 2019 - December 2019\n\n## Overview\n\nAs a team of four students, we developed a full-stack web application like Google Maps using agile development practices. This trip planner was originally created to explore the many breweries local to the Fort Collins area, and we later expanded the project to support national trips across the United States.\n\n## Development Journey\n\nStarting from just a map and non-functional components, we implemented features for creating a full-fledged trip planner. Our trip planner is used for planning plane trips, so routes are calculated 'as-the-crow-flies'.\n\n## Key Features\n\nImportant features include trip optimization using variations of 2-opt to remove loops in the trip route. Calculations are done server-side, and can be done automatically for the user based on how long the optimization will take. Additionally, the server is used to query a database which contains locations.\n\n## Customization\n\nThe trip display can be customized by changing route markers size, color, and icon. The itinerary allows items to be added manually, by search, and by file upload. File formats were standardized to allow interoperability between other trip planners.\n\n## Interoperability\n\nIn regards to interoperability, our server and client were independent of one another. Throughout the semester, we tested our client and server using our classmates'.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- React\n- npm\n- Git & GitHub\n- Java\n- Slack\n\n## Learning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of the semester, I learned how to lead a scrum sprint, and how to prevent and resolve conflicts in regards to the software development process. By the end, my team knocked it out of the park and received our highest score for the final demo.\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2019-08-tripco/index.mdx"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Brewery Trip Planner","date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","published":true}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
