As a team of three students, we built the hat to study the effect of positive reinforcement on Github contributions.\n\n## Technical Design\n\nThe hat's propeller was powered by a small DC motor. This motor was controlled by a LT239D integrated circuit which received signals from a Raspberry PI Zero W. The entire unit was powered by a 20700 li-ion battery and managed by a boost converter and charging module. The Raspberry Pi issued signals according to a Python script. The script created a web server for listening to post requests sent after a Git commit or push.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- Raspberry Pi Zero W\n- Python\n- Git & GitHub\n- Electronics & Microcontrollers\n- IoT Development\n\n## Results\n\nFrom our experiments, we found that commits increased by 500% while wearing the programming hat. We conclude the fun effect of the hat incentivizes users to make more Github contributions. The programming hat was voted best project by our classmates.\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2019-08-hat/index.mdx"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2020-05-workspaces/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"WorkSpace Self-Service Portal","date":"September 1, 2020"},"body":"\n**Amazon Web Services Internship** | May 2020 - August 2020\n\n## Key Achievements\n\n- Architected a React web application to enable remote work by reducing end-user's procurement time by 85%\n- Satisfied customer requests for highly available RESTful services after project demos\n- Integrated with existing smart card authentication by creating an identity provider\n- Reduced administrator overhead by integrating with customer's existing Active Directory\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- AWS\n- React\n- Python\n- Git\n- Windows\n- macOS\n\n## Impact\n\nThis self-service portal significantly improved the efficiency of workspace provisioning, enabling remote workers to quickly access the resources they needed during a critical time.\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2020-05-workspaces/index.mdx"}},"post":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2020-01-portfolio/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Portfolio Website","date":"January 1, 2020"},"body":"\n**Web Development** | January 2020 - Present\n\n## Overview\n\nThis portfolio's focus is freelance work and project exposure. Compared to previous portfolios, this application is a single page with a focus on easily updating and adding content.\n\n## Development Process\n\nTo accomplish this task, I converted a static page into a React project. The most difficult parts of this project were styling and evaluating my skills numerically.\n\n## Content Management\n\nTo make this website easier to update, I decided to use Gatsby to allow content creation via a dashboard. Finally, I am most proud of the administrator dashboard where I can modify the look and content without diving into code.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- React\n- npm\n- Git & GitHub\n- Sass\n- Gatsby\n\n## Links\n\n[View on GitHub](https://github.com/caseyjkey/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog)\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2020-01-portfolio/index.mdx"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Portfolio Website","date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","published":true}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
