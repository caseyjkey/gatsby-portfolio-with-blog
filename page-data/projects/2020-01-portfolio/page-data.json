This trip planner was originally created to explore the many breweries local to the Fort Collins area, and we later expanded the project to support national trips across the United States.\n\n## Development Journey\n\nStarting from just a map and non-functional components, we implemented features for creating a full-fledged trip planner. Our trip planner is used for planning plane trips, so routes are calculated 'as-the-crow-flies'.\n\n## Key Features\n\nImportant features include trip optimization using variations of 2-opt to remove loops in the trip route. Calculations are done server-side, and can be done automatically for the user based on how long the optimization will take. Additionally, the server is used to query a database which contains locations.\n\n## Customization\n\nThe trip display can be customized by changing route markers size, color, and icon. The itinerary allows items to be added manually, by search, and by file upload. File formats were standardized to allow interoperability between other trip planners.\n\n## Interoperability\n\nIn regards to interoperability, our server and client were independent of one another. Throughout the semester, we tested our client and server using our classmates'.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- React\n- npm\n- Git & GitHub\n- Java\n- Slack\n\n## Learning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of the semester, I learned how to lead a scrum sprint, and how to prevent and resolve conflicts in regards to the software development process. By the end, my team knocked it out of the park and received our highest score for the final demo.\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2019-08-tripco/index.mdx"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2019-08-hat/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Programming Hat","date":"January 1, 2020"},"body":"\n**IoT Development** | August 2019 - December 2019\n\n## Overview\n\nThe programming hat is a motorized propeller hat triggered by Github contributions. As a team of three students, we built the hat to study the effect of positive reinforcement on Github contributions.\n\n## Technical Design\n\nThe hat's propeller was powered by a small DC motor. This motor was controlled by a LT239D integrated circuit which received signals from a Raspberry PI Zero W. The entire unit was powered by a 20700 li-ion battery and managed by a boost converter and charging module. The Raspberry Pi issued signals according to a Python script. The script created a web server for listening to post requests sent after a Git commit or push.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- Raspberry Pi Zero W\n- Python\n- Git & GitHub\n- Electronics & Microcontrollers\n- IoT Development\n\n## Results\n\nFrom our experiments, we found that commits increased by 500% while wearing the programming hat. We conclude the fun effect of the hat incentivizes users to make more Github contributions. The programming hat was voted best project by our classmates.\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2019-08-hat/index.mdx"}},"post":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2020-01-portfolio/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Portfolio Website","date":"January 1, 2020"},"body":"\n**Web Development** | January 2020 - Present\n\n## Overview\n\nThis portfolio's focus is freelance work and project exposure. Compared to previous portfolios, this application is a single page with a focus on easily updating and adding content.\n\n## Development Process\n\nTo accomplish this task, I converted a static page into a React project. The most difficult parts of this project were styling and evaluating my skills numerically.\n\n## Content Management\n\nTo make this website easier to update, I decided to use Gatsby to allow content creation via a dashboard. Finally, I am most proud of the administrator dashboard where I can modify the look and content without diving into code.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- React\n- npm\n- Git & GitHub\n- Sass\n- Gatsby\n\n## Links\n\n[View on GitHub](https://github.com/caseyjkey/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog)\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2020-01-portfolio/index.mdx"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Portfolio Website","date":"2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","published":true}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
