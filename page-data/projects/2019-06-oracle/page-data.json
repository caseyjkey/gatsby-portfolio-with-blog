My favorite challenges for this project were designing the page in Photoshop, exporting the images for responsive layouts, and adding interactivity using jQuery.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- Photoshop\n- JavaScript\n- jQuery\n- Bootstrap\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\nTo extend this project, I would like to connect the project's from my current portfolio into this portfolio; this would allow me to update both websites from the same content management system! Also, I would like to add more features to enhance the experience on mobile devices.\n\n## Links\n\n[View Live Site](https://caseyjkey.github.io/portfolio/)\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2018-12-uxportfolio/index.mdx"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2019-08-tripco/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Trip Planner","date":"January 1, 2020"},"body":"\n**Software Engineering** | August 2019 - December 2019\n\n## Overview\n\nAs a team of four students, we developed a full-stack web application like Google Maps using agile development practices.\n\n## Development Journey\n\nStarting from just a map and non-functional components, we implemented features for creating a full-fledged trip planner. Our trip planner is used for planning plane trips, so routes are calculated 'as-the-crow-flies'.\n\n## Key Features\n\nImportant features include trip optimization using variations of 2-opt to remove loops in the trip route. Calculations are done server-side, and can be done automatically for the user based on how long the optimization will take. Additionally, the server is used to query a database which contains locations.\n\n## Customization\n\nThe trip display can be customized by changing route markers size, color, and icon. The itinerary allows items to be added manually, by search, and by file upload. File formats were standardized to allow interoperability between other trip planners.\n\n## Interoperability\n\nIn regards to interoperability, our server and client were independent of one another. Throughout the semester, we tested our client and server using our classmates'.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- React\n- npm\n- Git & GitHub\n- Java\n- Slack\n\n## Learning Outcomes\n\nBy the end of the semester, I learned how to lead a scrum sprint, and how to prevent and resolve conflicts in regards to the software development process. By the end, my team knocked it out of the park and received our highest score for the final demo.\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2019-08-tripco/index.mdx"}},"post":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2019-06-oracle/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Live Sentiment Analysis","date":"September 1, 2019"},"body":"\n**Oracle Scholars Internship** | June 2019 - August 2019\n\n## Overview\n\nMy team showcased the power of Oracle Cloud to a fintech bank's CEO for our summer 2019 internship at Oracle in Reston, VA.\n\n## Product Features\n\nOur product presented the CEO with insights for increasing revenue by cross-selling bank services, live brand management, and recommendations for future product placement or relocation. My team calculated these insights by combining seven unique data sources using Oracle Cloud's powerful autonomous database.\n\n## Live Data Integration\n\nTwo of the sources were live data from Twitter and news websites and harnesses a large amount of fast-moving data to give you perspective on how people feel about any topic of your choice. Now the impact of any product announcement, earnings report, or press release can be measured and addressed by the appropriate faculty.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nOur product demonstrated the capabilities of Oracle Autonomous Database by consolidating data across many systems. With this data, we used tools such as Oracle Analytics Cloud for intuitive data visualizations. Overall, we created four dashboards analyzing revenue sources, public brand perception, the customer, and profitability.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- Python\n- Oracle Database\n- Oracle Cloud\n- Twitter API\n- News APIs\n- Analytics Tools\n\n## Presentation & Learning\n\nAt the end of the internship, we presented our work to the office, including our manager and mentor. Our colleagues were interested in my sentiment analysis algorithm and how I was able to integrate my software into the Oracle Cloud ecosystem of products. I learned to sell my work by emphasizing the value it provides to the customer. My mentor taught me to frame our pitch and demo toward a persona, which for us was the CEO of a fintech bank.\n\n## Memorable Experience\n\nMy favorite memory from this internship was a tubing trip down the Potomac river. I am thankful for the opportunity to work at a top software company where I met many talented people.\n\n## Links\n\n[View on GitHub](https://github.com/caseyjkey/twitter-sentiment-analysis)\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2019-06-oracle/index.mdx"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Live Sentiment Analysis","date":"2019-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","published":true}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
