Also, I would like to add more features to enhance the experience on mobile devices.\n\n## Links\n\n[View Live Site](https://caseyjkey.github.io/portfolio/)\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2018-12-uxportfolio/index.mdx"}},"post":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2018-05-whatspython/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Python Curriculum & Blog","date":"August 1, 2018"},"body":"\n**Curriculum Development** | May 2018 - July 2018\n\n## Overview\n\nIn May of 2017 I was hired to be a student instructor for the Northrop Grumman STEM Camp. To teach high school students with no programming experience, I developed a curriculum and hosted it as a blog.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nThe blog was hosted on Namecheap with a custom domain. Content was created and managed using Wordpress. Features were extended using PHP and plugins to provide social functions such as profiles and commenting.\n\n## Curriculum Content\n\nOn this blog, I posted lessons as blog posts including videos for:\n\n- Setting up the environment\n- Using variables\n- Control flow\n- Methods\n- Classes and using objects\n- Creating games using modules\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- WordPress\n- PHP\n- Python\n- Game Development\n\n## Impact & Recognition\n\nI discovered an unexpected love for teaching when I received my award. When I went up to the stage for recognition as an instructor, my students all cheered for me. This success has motivated me to keep curriculum development on my mind ever since.\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2018-05-whatspython/index.mdx"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Python Curriculum & Blog","date":"2018-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","published":true}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
