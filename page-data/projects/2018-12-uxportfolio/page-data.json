Motivated to recognize musicians for their work and spearhead SingularDTV's (now Breaker) challenge, I won myself and a friend on the idea of developing a top musician billboard powered by blockchain.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThis music billboard is a curated list of high-quality musicians. It works like a game where token holders control which musicians are listed. Applying to be on the top musician list requires a deposit to prevent trolls and spam submissions. The token holders are incentivized to maintain the quality of the list by challenging applications. If a challenge is successful, the voters are rewarded with the applicant's deposit.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- React\n- Ethereum\n- Bootstrap\n- GitHub\n- Firebase\n- Heroku\n\n## Achievement\n\nThe result of over 40 hours of hacking, my team created a billboard which impressed SingularDTV's team. We won an all expense paid trip to San Francisco, CA, to attend Our Music Festival. Our Music Festival was inspirational to attend as it was the world's first blockchain music festival.\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2018-09-billboard/index.mdx"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2019-06-oracle/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Live Sentiment Analysis","date":"June 1, 2019"},"body":"\n**Oracle Scholars Internship** | June 2019 - August 2019\n\n## Overview\n\nMy team showcased the power of Oracle Cloud to a fintech bank's CEO for our summer 2019 internship at Oracle in Reston, VA.\n\n## Product Features\n\nOur product presented the CEO with insights for increasing revenue by cross-selling bank services, live brand management, and recommendations for future product placement or relocation. My team calculated these insights by combining seven unique data sources using Oracle Cloud's powerful autonomous database.\n\n## Live Data Integration\n\nTwo of the sources were live data from Twitter and news websites and harnesses a large amount of fast-moving data to give you perspective on how people feel about any topic of your choice. Now the impact of any product announcement, earnings report, or press release can be measured and addressed by the appropriate faculty.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nOur product demonstrated the capabilities of Oracle Autonomous Database by consolidating data across many systems. With this data, we used tools such as Oracle Analytics Cloud for intuitive data visualizations. Overall, we created four dashboards analyzing revenue sources, public brand perception, the customer, and profitability.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- Python\n- Oracle Database\n- Oracle Cloud\n- Twitter API\n- News APIs\n- Analytics Tools\n\n## Presentation & Learning\n\nAt the end of the internship, we presented our work to the office, including our manager and mentor. Our colleagues were interested in my sentiment analysis algorithm and how I was able to integrate my software into the Oracle Cloud ecosystem of products. I learned to sell my work by emphasizing the value it provides to the customer. My mentor taught me to frame our pitch and demo toward a persona, which for us was the CEO of a fintech bank.\n\n## Memorable Experience\n\nMy favorite memory from this internship was a tubing trip down the Potomac river. I am thankful for the opportunity to work at a top software company where I met many talented people.\n\n## Links\n\n[View on GitHub](https://github.com/caseyjkey/twitter-sentiment-analysis)\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2019-06-oracle/index.mdx"}},"post":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2018-12-uxportfolio/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Innovative UI/UX Portfolio","date":"December 1, 2018"},"body":"\n**Web Development** | December 2018 - January 2019\n\n## Overview\n\nThis portfolio website serves as an interactive experience for viewing projects. My favorite challenges for this project were designing the page in Photoshop, exporting the images for responsive layouts, and adding interactivity using jQuery.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- Photoshop\n- JavaScript\n- jQuery\n- Bootstrap\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\nTo extend this project, I would like to connect the project's from my current portfolio into this portfolio; this would allow me to update both websites from the same content management system! Also, I would like to add more features to enhance the experience on mobile devices.\n\n## Links\n\n[View Live Site](https://caseyjkey.github.io/portfolio/)\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2018-12-uxportfolio/index.mdx"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Innovative UI/UX Portfolio","date":"2018-12-01T00:00:00.000Z","published":true}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
