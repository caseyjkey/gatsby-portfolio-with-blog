My team calculated these insights by combining seven unique data sources using Oracle Cloud's powerful autonomous database.\n\n## Live Data Integration\n\nTwo of the sources were live data from Twitter and news websites and harnesses a large amount of fast-moving data to give you perspective on how people feel about any topic of your choice. Now the impact of any product announcement, earnings report, or press release can be measured and addressed by the appropriate faculty.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nOur product demonstrated the capabilities of Oracle Autonomous Database by consolidating data across many systems. With this data, we used tools such as Oracle Analytics Cloud for intuitive data visualizations. Overall, we created four dashboards analyzing revenue sources, public brand perception, the customer, and profitability.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- Python\n- Oracle Database\n- Oracle Cloud\n- Twitter API\n- News APIs\n- Analytics Tools\n\n## Presentation & Learning\n\nAt the end of the internship, we presented our work to the office, including our manager and mentor. Our colleagues were interested in my sentiment analysis algorithm and how I was able to integrate my software into the Oracle Cloud ecosystem of products. I learned to sell my work by emphasizing the value it provides to the customer. My mentor taught me to frame our pitch and demo toward a persona, which for us was the CEO of a fintech bank.\n\n## Memorable Experience\n\nMy favorite memory from this internship was a tubing trip down the Potomac river. I am thankful for the opportunity to work at a top software company where I met many talented people.\n\n## Links\n\n[View on GitHub](https://github.com/caseyjkey/twitter-sentiment-analysis)\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2019-06-oracle/index.mdx"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2020-01-portfolio/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Portfolio Website","date":"January 1, 2020"},"body":"\n**Web Development** | January 2020 - Present\n\n## Overview\n\nThis portfolio's focus is freelance work and project exposure. Compared to previous portfolios, this application is a single page with a focus on easily updating and adding content.\n\n## Development Process\n\nTo accomplish this task, I converted a static page into a React project. The most difficult parts of this project were styling and evaluating my skills numerically.\n\n## Content Management\n\nTo make this website easier to update, I decided to use Gatsby to allow content creation via a dashboard. Finally, I am most proud of the administrator dashboard where I can modify the look and content without diving into code.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- React\n- npm\n- Git & GitHub\n- Sass\n- Gatsby\n\n## Links\n\n[View on GitHub](https://github.com/caseyjkey/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog)\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2020-01-portfolio/index.mdx"}},"post":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2019-08-hat/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Programming Hat","date":"August 1, 2019"},"body":"\n**IoT Development** | August 2019 - December 2019\n\n## Overview\n\nThe programming hat is a motorized propeller hat triggered by Github contributions. As a team of three students, we built the hat to study the effect of positive reinforcement on Github contributions.\n\n## Technical Design\n\nThe hat's propeller was powered by a small DC motor. This motor was controlled by a LT239D integrated circuit which received signals from a Raspberry PI Zero W. The entire unit was powered by a 20700 li-ion battery and managed by a boost converter and charging module. The Raspberry Pi issued signals according to a Python script. The script created a web server for listening to post requests sent after a Git commit or push.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- Raspberry Pi Zero W\n- Python\n- Git & GitHub\n- Electronics & Microcontrollers\n- IoT Development\n\n## Results\n\nFrom our experiments, we found that commits increased by 500% while wearing the programming hat. We conclude the fun effect of the hat incentivizes users to make more Github contributions. The programming hat was voted best project by our classmates.\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2019-08-hat/index.mdx"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"Programming Hat","date":"2019-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","published":true}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
