Compared to previous portfolios, this application is a single page with a focus on easily updating and adding content.\n\n## Development Process\n\nTo accomplish this task, I converted a static page into a React project. The most difficult parts of this project were styling and evaluating my skills numerically.\n\n## Content Management\n\nTo make this website easier to update, I decided to use Gatsby to allow content creation via a dashboard. Finally, I am most proud of the administrator dashboard where I can modify the look and content without diving into code.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- React\n- npm\n- Git & GitHub\n- Sass\n- Gatsby\n\n## Links\n\n[View on GitHub](https://github.com/caseyjkey/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog)\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2020-01-portfolio/index.mdx"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2022-08-datacatalog/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Amazon.com Data Catalog","date":"August 1, 2022"},"body":"\n**Software Development Engineer** | August 2022 - April 2024\n\n## Key Contributions\n\n- Built React application to onboard many datasets at once, reducing registration time by 10x\n- Generated Java-based API from Smithy specification, which included data validation and authentication\n- Reduced customer support tickets by adding a service status banner during outages\n- Minimized accounting response time by automating expense processing and report deliveries\n- Modernized production web application to improve user experience and reduce technical debt\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- AWS\n- React\n- Java\n- Git\n- GraphQL\n- Redux\n- macOS\n\n## Impact\n\nThe data catalog improvements significantly enhanced the efficiency of data management across Amazon.com, making it easier for teams to discover, register, and manage their datasets.\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2022-08-datacatalog/index.mdx"}},"post":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2020-05-workspaces/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"WorkSpace Self-Service Portal","date":"May 1, 2020"},"body":"\n**Amazon Web Services Internship** | May 2020 - August 2020\n\n## Key Achievements\n\n- Architected a React web application to enable remote work by reducing end-user's procurement time by 85%\n- Satisfied customer requests for highly available RESTful services after project demos\n- Integrated with existing smart card authentication by creating an identity provider\n- Reduced administrator overhead by integrating with customer's existing Active Directory\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- AWS\n- React\n- Python\n- Git\n- Windows\n- macOS\n\n## Impact\n\nThis self-service portal significantly improved the efficiency of workspace provisioning, enabling remote workers to quickly access the resources they needed during a critical time.\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2020-05-workspaces/index.mdx"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"WorkSpace Self-Service Portal","date":"2020-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","published":true}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
