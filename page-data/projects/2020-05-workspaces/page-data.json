Compared to previous portfolios, this application is a single page with a focus on easily updating and adding content.\n\n## Development Process\n\nTo accomplish this task, I converted a static page into a React project. The most difficult parts of this project were styling and evaluating my skills numerically.\n\n## Content Management\n\nTo make this website easier to update, I decided to use Gatsby to allow content creation via a dashboard. Finally, I am most proud of the administrator dashboard where I can modify the look and content without diving into code.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- React\n- npm\n- Git & GitHub\n- Sass\n- Gatsby\n\n## Links\n\n[View on GitHub](https://github.com/caseyjkey/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog)\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2020-01-portfolio/index.mdx"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2018-09-billboard/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Music Billboard","date":"October 1, 2020"},"body":"\n**Blockchain Development** | September 2018 - September 2020\n\n## Overview\n\nFor the 2018 WyoHackathon, I wanted to extend EtherRadio. Motivated to recognize musicians for their work and spearhead SingularDTV's (now Breaker) challenge, I won myself and a friend on the idea of developing a top musician billboard powered by blockchain.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThis music billboard is a curated list of high-quality musicians. It works like a game where token holders control which musicians are listed. Applying to be on the top musician list requires a deposit to prevent trolls and spam submissions. The token holders are incentivized to maintain the quality of the list by challenging applications. If a challenge is successful, the voters are rewarded with the applicant's deposit.\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- React\n- Ethereum\n- Bootstrap\n- GitHub\n- Firebase\n- Heroku\n\n## Achievement\n\nThe result of over 40 hours of hacking, my team created a billboard which impressed SingularDTV's team. We won an all expense paid trip to San Francisco, CA, to attend Our Music Festival. Our Music Festival was inspirational to attend as it was the world's first blockchain music festival.\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2018-09-billboard/index.mdx"}},"post":{"fields":{"slug":"/projects/2020-05-workspaces/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"WorkSpace Self-Service Portal","date":"September 1, 2020"},"body":"\n**Amazon Web Services Internship** | May 2020 - August 2020\n\n## Key Achievements\n\n- Architected a React web application to enable remote work by reducing end-user's procurement time by 85%\n- Satisfied customer requests for highly available RESTful services after project demos\n- Integrated with existing smart card authentication by creating an identity provider\n- Reduced administrator overhead by integrating with customer's existing Active Directory\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n- AWS\n- React\n- Python\n- Git\n- Windows\n- macOS\n\n## Impact\n\nThis self-service portal significantly improved the efficiency of workspace provisioning, enabling remote workers to quickly access the resources they needed during a critical time.\n","internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/trill/Development/gatsby-portfolio-with-blog/posts/projects/2020-05-workspaces/index.mdx"}},"frontmatter":{"title":"WorkSpace Self-Service Portal","date":"2020-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","published":true}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
