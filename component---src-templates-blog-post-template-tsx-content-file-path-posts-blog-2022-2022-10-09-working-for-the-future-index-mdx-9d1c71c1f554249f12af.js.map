I would be foregoing current pleasure for a potential future of nothing, e.g. boredom. Since I have no goal for retiring early, I may as well use the savings to instead invest in more risky assets. For example, a business. Then, as I age, I will purchase more conventional investments like houses, bonds, and stocks.

So how can we buy our toys and their accoutrements? We want to have assets to rely on later in life, so buying them outright is not the smart option, as we would only have liabilties and added expenses (insurance, registration, maintenance). However, the house can be considered an asset. Can we kill two birds with one stone? Using a car financing calculator and rental income calculator, we could finance a $120,000 supercar with 20% down for around $2000 a month. To achieve this, we would need two $500,000 houses bought for 4.5% interest and 20% down. This would give us a new cashflow of about $2,000 a month. Then, we can have our supercar paid for while also having an appreciating asset. At my current savings rate, one house would take 13 months to acquire. Then, if we use the income from that property to fund the second, we need 14 months to acquire the downpayment. Finally, we need the downpayment for the car, this would take 3 months with both properties bringing income. In total, we would have our car in 30 months. This would be 2.5 years.

Then, house two would take 10 months. Then, we would have the car downpayment in a bit more than a month (if we could produce a litter after purchasing our second house).
