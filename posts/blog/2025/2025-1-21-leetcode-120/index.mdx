Today I start working on multidimensional DP. I expect these problems to require a dynamicly-sized array
to build a solution, rather than a static number of variables.
I chose to write about this problem because it is a great example
of how we can think of a problem from the bottom up to build an optimal solution.

# Initial Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def minimumTotal(self, triangle: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        rows = len(triangle)
        memo = triangle[-1][:]
        for row in range(rows - 2, -1, -1):
            for col in range(row + 1):
                memo[col] = min(memo[col], memo[col + 1]) + triangle[row][col]
        return memo[0]
```
Time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n).
