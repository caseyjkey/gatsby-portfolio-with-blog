Here's another backtracking problem. For this post, I'd like to discuss the differences between
my solution and another submitted solution.

# My Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        results = []
        def backtrack(openP, closedP, curr):
            if openP == n and closedP == n:
                results.append(''.join(curr))
                return
            
            if openP != n:
                curr.append('(')
                backtrack(openP + 1, closedP, curr)
                curr.pop()

            if closedP < openP:
                curr.append(')')
                backtrack(openP, closedP + 1, curr)
                curr.pop()

        backtrack(0, 0, [])
        return results
```
The time complexity is O(2n * Catalan(n)) since for each solution (there are Catalan(n))  of the recursion stack, we work on N-i subproblems, where i is from 0 to k. The space complexity is O(k * n choose k) since each result requires k space. 
# niits' Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def generateParenthesis(self, n: int) -> List[str]:
        res = []

        def dfs(openP, closeP, s):
            if openP == closeP and openP + closeP == n * 2:
                res.append(s)
                return
            
            if openP < n:
                dfs(openP + 1, closeP, s + "(")
            
            if closeP < openP:
                dfs(openP, closeP + 1, s + ")")

        dfs(0, 0, "")

        return res
```
The main differences I see are the base case and use of string concatanation.
I believe there is marginal difference in time complexity for my equality checks
and niits' addition plus multiplication equality. My solution is more readable.
The use of string concatanation by niits' is easier to read, but it uses more memory
as each recursive call creates a new string while mine is passed between each recursive call.
The duplication of strings by recursive calls adds an average of 2n complexity to the 
existing 2n complexity found in my solution.
