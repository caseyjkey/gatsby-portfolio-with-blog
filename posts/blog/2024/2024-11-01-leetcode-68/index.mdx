This took a while to solve. I completed it over two days, then I had the help of ChatGPT to analyze the complexity.
I reviewed other answers and I didn't find simpler methods.

# Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def fullJustify(self, words: List[str], maxWidth: int) -> List[str]:
        width = 0
        rows = []
        row = []
        for word in words:
            line = ' '.join(row + [word])
            if len(line) > maxWidth:
                charCount = len(''.join(row))
                spaceRemaining = maxWidth - charCount
                if len(row) > 1:
                    spaces = [spaceRemaining // (len(row) - 1) for _ in range(len(row) - 1)]
                    for i in range(spaceRemaining % (len(row) - 1)):
                        spaces[i] += 1
                else:
                    spaces = [spaceRemaining]
                print(spaces, row)
                line = ''
                for i in range(len(row)):
                    line += row[i]
                    if i < len(spaces):
                        line += ' ' * spaces[i]
                rows.append(line)
                row = []
            row.append(word)

        charCount = len(' '.join(row))
        spaceRemaining = maxWidth - charCount
        line = ' '.join(row)
        line += ' ' * spaceRemaining
        rows.append(line)
        return rows

```
O(n) = n * m where n is the number of words and m is the average row length
