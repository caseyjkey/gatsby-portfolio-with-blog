Last problem for this study set's sliding window problems.

# Solution
This is my initial greedy solution. It passes initial test cases, but fails longer inputs.
```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        def containsT(substring):
            letters = list(t[:])
            for i in substring:
                if i in letters:
                    letters.remove(i)
            return len(letters) == 0

        n = len(t)
        m = len(s)
        windowSize = n
        while windowSize <= m:
            for i in range(0, m):
                substring = s[i:i+windowSize]
                if containsT(substring):
                    return substring
            windowSize += 1
        return ""
```
Now to optimize my solution, I plan on stepping through the `s` string, and tracking how many counts of `t` letters are found. This should be faster as we are keeping track of letter counts as we go, instead of searching for all letters in the substring for each iteration.
```python
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        letterCounts = dict()
        for letter in t:
            if letter in letterCounts:
                letterCounts[letter] += 1
            else:
                letterCounts[letter] = 1
        
        start = 0
        end = 0
        windowLength = len(s) + 1
        minStart = 0
        lettersRemaining = len(t)

        while end < len(s):
            if s[end] in letterCounts:
                if letterCounts[s[end]] > 0:
                    lettersRemaining -= 1
                letterCounts[s[end]] -= 1
            
            while lettersRemaining == 0:
                if end - start + 1 < windowLength:
                    windowLength = end - start + 1
                    minStart = start
                if s[start] in letterCounts:
                    letterCounts[s[start]] += 1
                    if letterCounts[s[start]] > 0:
                        lettersRemaining += 1
                start += 1
            end += 1

        if windowLength == len(s) + 1:
            return ""
        else:
            return s[minStart:minStart + windowLength]

        return ""
```
