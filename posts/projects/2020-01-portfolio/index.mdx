**Web Development** | January 2020 - Present

## Overview

This portfolio's focus is freelance work and project exposure. Compared to previous portfolios, this application is a single page with a focus on easily updating and adding content.

## Development Process

To accomplish this task, I converted a static page into a React project. The most difficult parts of this project were styling and evaluating my skills numerically.

## Content Management

To make this website easier to update, I decided to use Gatsby to allow content creation via a dashboard. Finally, I am most proud of the administrator dashboard where I can modify the look and content without diving into code.

## Technologies Used

- React
- npm
- Git & GitHub
