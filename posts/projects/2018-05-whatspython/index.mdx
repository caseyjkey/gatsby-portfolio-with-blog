**Curriculum Development** | May 2018 - July 2018

## Overview

In May of 2017 I was hired to be a student instructor for the Northrop Grumman STEM Camp. To teach high school students with no programming experience, I developed a curriculum and hosted it as a blog.

## Technical Implementation

The blog was hosted on Namecheap with a custom domain. Content was created and managed using Wordpress. Features were extended using PHP and plugins to provide social functions such as profiles and commenting.

## Curriculum Content

On this blog, I posted lessons as blog posts including videos for:

- Setting up the environment
- Using variables
- Control flow
- Methods
- Classes and using objects
- Creating games using modules

## Technologies Used

- WordPress
- PHP
- Python
- Game Development

## Impact & Recognition

I discovered an unexpected love for teaching when I received my award. When I went up to the stage for recognition as an instructor, my students all cheered for me. This success has motivated me to keep curriculum development on my mind ever since.
