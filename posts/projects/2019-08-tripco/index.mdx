**Software Engineering** | August 2019 - December 2019

## Overview

As a team of four students, we developed a full-stack web application like Google Maps using agile development practices.

## Development Journey

Starting from just a map and non-functional components, we implemented features for creating a full-fledged trip planner. Our trip planner is used for planning plane trips, so routes are calculated 'as-the-crow-flies'.

## Key Features

Important features include trip optimization using variations of 2-opt to remove loops in the trip route. Calculations are done server-side, and can be done automatically for the user based on how long the optimization will take. Additionally, the server is used to query a database which contains locations.

## Customization

The trip display can be customized by changing route markers size, color, and icon. The itinerary allows items to be added manually, by search, and by file upload. File formats were standardized to allow interoperability between other trip planners.

## Interoperability

In regards to interoperability, our server and client were independent of one another. Throughout the semester, we tested our client and server using our classmates'.

## Technologies Used

- React
- npm
- Git & GitHub
- Java
- Slack

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the semester, I learned how to lead a scrum sprint, and how to prevent and resolve conflicts in regards to the software development process. By the end, my team knocked it out of the park and received our highest score for the final demo.
