This problem was tricky as I had to track Node references rather than the index given in the input.

# Solution
```python
from collections import defaultdict
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
"""

class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        start = Node(head.val) if head else None
        node = start
        randoms = defaultdict(list)
        nodes = {}
        while head:
            nodes[head] = node
            node.next = Node(head.next.val) if head.next else None
            node.val = head.val
            if head.random:
                randoms[head.random].append(head)
            head = head.next
            node = node.next
        
        for val in randoms.keys():
            for neighbor in randoms[val]:
                nodes[neighbor].random = nodes[val]

        return start
```
O(n) = n since worst case is 2n due to the while loop, then at most visiting each node again when assigning the randoms' value.
