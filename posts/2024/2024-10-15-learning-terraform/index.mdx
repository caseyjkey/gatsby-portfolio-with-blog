The intial phone screen for the StubHub interview went well.
I was asked about my experience with Terraform. I admitted that I have only used it once before. and it has been many years since then.
However, I used AWS CDK frequently at my last job with Amazon. I hope that experience will help me learn Terraform.
I'm going to write about my learning process for Terraform before my next interview sometime within the next week.

# Learning Terraform

## Initial Research
After installing Terraform within WSL, I started the [Terraform Tutorial for AWS](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started).
I'm going to follow this tutorial to learn the basics of Terraform, focusing on adding AWS resources as this is mentioned in Glassdoor interviews.

## First Impressions
The Terraform CLI is easy to use. I made a `.tf` file and defined a Docker container and image.
I ran `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply`.
I'm impressed that Terraform created and ran a Docker container that quickly.

## AWS
Next, I created a new AWS account and configured the AWS CLI within WSL.
I created a new `main.tf` file and added an AWS provider and EC2 instance resource.

# Next Steps

I plan on taking the Terraform Associate certification exam sometime in the next month.
I'm going to study using the [Terraform Associate Certification Guide](https://www.terraform.io/docs/terraform-associate-certification-guide.pdf).
