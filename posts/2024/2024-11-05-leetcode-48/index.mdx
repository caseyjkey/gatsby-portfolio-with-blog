Working through more matrix problems today.

# Solution
I used a method where we transpose the matrix, then reverse the rows. This is memory efficient in space and locality.
```python
class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(matrix)):
                matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
        
        for i in range(len(matrix)):
            matrix[i] = matrix[i][::-1]
        
        return matrix
```
(n) = n^2 since we have nested loops dependent on input size.
