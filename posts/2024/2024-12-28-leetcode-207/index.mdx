Today I worked on a general graph problem. My initial solution was much more verbose and less readable than
another coder's solution. However, I feel like during an interview I would have been able to derive
the simpler solution through asking questions, such as whether any course number will exceed the numCourses variable.
I also need to be more mindful of what data I need to track or else I create unnecessary classes.

# My Solution
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val: int, toNodes: List['Node'] = None, fromNodes: List['Node'] = None):
        self.val = val
        self.toNodes = toNodes if toNodes is not None else []
        self.fromNodes = fromNodes if fromNodes is not None else []

class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        if not prerequisites:
            return True

        nodes = {}
        for after, before in prerequisites:
            if after not in nodes:
                nodes[after] = Node(after)
            afterNode = nodes[after]

            if before not in nodes:
                nodes[before] = Node(before)
            beforeNode = nodes[before]
            beforeNode.toNodes.append(afterNode)
            afterNode.fromNodes.append(beforeNode)
        
        topological_order = []
        stack = set()
        visited = set()
        has_cycle = False
        def dfs(node):
            nonlocal has_cycle
            if node in stack:
                return False
            if node in visited:
                return True
            
            stack.add(node)
            print(node.val)
            for child in node.toNodes:
                if not dfs(child):
                    has_cycle = True
            stack.remove(node)
            visited.add(node)
            topological_order.append(node.val)
            return True
        
        for node in nodes.values():
            #if not node.fromNodes:
            dfs(node)
            if has_cycle:
                return False

        return len(topological_order) <= numCourses
```
The time complexity is O(M + N) where M are the number of nodes and N are the number of edges, as each are visited once. The space complexity is the same as it grows linearly with the input size.
I used a class to build a directed graph which I could use to attempt a topological sort,
this sort would allow me to check if there are less courses than numCourses and also detect cycles.
However, the problem states numCourses is always less than the course numbers, we could instead
check each course if we may satisfy it's given prerequisites up to numCourses.
By default, we can say a course doesn't have any prerequisites. Therefor, we only
need to check if there is ever a cycle, which we can detect using a set that tracks 
which courses we've taken.

If we can go through every course up to numCourses without visiting a taken class,
we can return true. The topological order is unnecessary, however, it is given that 
a topological order exists if we can complete the courses.
# Improved Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        from collections import defaultdict

        pres = defaultdict(list)
        for course, pre in prerequisites:
            pres[course].append(pre)
        
        taken = set()
        def dfs(course):
            if not pres[course]:
                return True
            
            if course in taken:
                return False # Cycle detected
            
            taken.add(course)
            for pre in pres[course]:
                if not dfs(pre):
                    return False
            
            pres[course] = []
            return True
        
        for course in range(numCourses):
            if not dfs(course):
                return False
        
        return True
```
