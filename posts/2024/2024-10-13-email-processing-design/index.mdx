The intial phone screen for the StubHub interview went well.
I was asked about my experience with Terraform. I admitted that I have only used it once before. and it has been many years since then.
However, I used AWS CDK frequently at my last job with Amazon. I hope that experience will help me learn Terraform.
I'm going to write about my learning process for Terraform before my next interview sometime within the next week.

# Learning Terraform

## Initial Research
After installing Terraform within WSL, I started the [Terraform Tutorial for AWS](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started).
I'm going to follow this tutorial to learn the basics of Terraform, focusing on adding AWS resources as this is mentioned in Glassdoor interviews.
