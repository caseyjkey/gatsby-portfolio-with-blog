Starting with a hard problem today.

# Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def findSubstring(self, s: str, words: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        lenTotal = len(''.join(words))
        perms = set()
        def permutations(head, tail):
            if not len(head):
                perms.add(tail)
            for i in range(len(head)):
                permutations(head[:i] + head[i+1:], tail + head[i])
        permutations(words, '')

        result = []
        for i in range(0, len(s)):
            if s[i:i+lenTotal] in perms:
                result.append(i)
        
        return result
```
This solution times out. It has a time complexity of O(n) = n! due to the permutations method.

I'm going to try again using python's `itertools.permutations` method. However, this lead to an out of memory error.
Rethinking the algorithm, we can remove the step where we find all permutations. Instead, we will replace our `perms` set with a method called `validSubstring(substring)`. This method will use a copy of the list of words, and we will loop through the substring and remove any word occurrences. If we always find a word at each step in our substring, we return True. We improve the efficiency of our algorithm by caching the result of each substring as either `validSubstring` or `invalidSubstring` set members. This solution is accepted.

````python
import itertools

class Solution:
    def findSubstring(self, s: str, words: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        if len(s) < len(''.join(words)):
            return []

        wordLen = len(words[0])
        def validSubstring(substring):
            wordsTemp = words[:]
            for i in range(0, len(substring), wordLen):
                currWord = substring[i:i + wordLen]
                if currWord in wordsTemp:
                    wordsTemp.remove(currWord)
                else:
                    return False
            return True
        
        invalidSubstrings = set()
        validSubstrings = set()
        wordsLen = wordLen * len(words)
        window = s[:wordsLen]
        res = []
        if validSubstring(window):
            validSubstrings.add(window)
            res.append(0)

        for i in range(wordsLen, len(s)):
            letter = s[i]
            window = window[1:]
            window += letter
            if window not in invalidSubstrings:
                if window in validSubstrings or validSubstring(window):
                    res.append(i - wordsLen + 1)
                    validSubstrings.add(window)
                else:
                    invalidSubstrings.add(window)
        
        return res
```
The time complexity is O(n) = n * k^2 where k is the number of words. It is k^2 because we loop through k words and the remove operation is O(k) = k.
