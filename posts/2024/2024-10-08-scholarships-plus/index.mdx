I've began a new project, scholarships-plus. This will be a CRUD app for tracking and improving scholarship essays.

# App Idea
I am creating this app to improve student's scholarship essays by improving their past submissions.
This app will allow students to upload their essays, and then use AI to improve them.
I want to implement RAG to give context to essay prompts. 

# Framework Choice
## Next.js vs Remix
At first, I wanted to use Next.js as my React framework since I used it while working with Amazon.
However, I noticed that Next.js is more popular for its server-side rendering features.
Since this will be a client-side app, I decided improved SEO through SSR is not needed for this app.
So, I decided to look into Remix. It looks great for building fast web apps with a focus on developer experience.
I'm glad to have found a [great starter project](https://remix.run/resources/remix-blues-stack) integrating Postgres for the database, Cypress for testing, and a full CI/CD workflow through Github Actions.
However, I feel like I am losing experience from setting all these features up from scratch. Hopefully the benefits of each component become apparent once I begin implementing my scholarship app.
