## More code!

Mind `Dump`!
Using `prism-react-renderer`:

```jsx
let intro = []

let stanza1 = [
    "Home is where the wind fills our sails.",
    "Although many don't sail away from here.",
    "With a lake much like the sea",
    "Sailing what we've already seen.",
    "While we wait for our ship to come and take us away",
    "Well we've got many days before we go!"
]

let chorus = [ 
    "Moon pies filled with singly sweet creams",
    "Dreams already made for you and me",
    "So I'll see you when I wake up",
    "But fever dreams have taken over me"
]

let stanza2 = [
    "So decorate our time like it's makeup",
    "Music and Patron for the bros",
    "We're getting collared up",
    "Walk into the pub like it's a stickup",
    "Play a couple games of pool, hold up",
    "Hit the store to get our stomachs filled up"
]

const Dump = (props) => (
  <div
    style={{
      fontSize: 20,
      border: '1px solid #efefef',
      padding: 10,
      background: 'white',
    }}
  >
    {Object.entries(props).map(([key, val]) => (
      <pre key={key}>
        <strong style={{ color: 'white', background: 'red' }}>
          {key} ðŸ’©
        </strong>
        {JSON.stringify(val, '', ' ')}
      </pre>
    ))}
  </div>
)

render(<Dump props={[stanza1, chorus, stanza2, chorus]} />)
```
