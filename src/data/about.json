  "bio": "The potential effect of technology on society thrills me! My dream is to travel the world as a tech entrepreneur. My focus will be in cybersecurity, teaching, and apps for education, finance, and music. After starting successful businesses, I want to give back by providing jobs, scholarships, and education with a focus on at-risk youth. <br /><br /> When I'm not coding, I enjoy skateboarding, sports, car tuning, and building sound systems. I'm happy to help anyone learn more about technology.",
