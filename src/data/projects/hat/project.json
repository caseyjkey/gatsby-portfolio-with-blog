  "description": "The programming hat is a motorized propeller hat triggered by Github contributions. As a team of three students, we built the hat to study the effect of positive reinforcement on Github contributions.\n<br /><br /> The hat's propeller was powered by a small DC motor. This motor was controlled by a\nLT239D integrated circuit which received signals from a Raspberry PI Zero W. The entire unit was powered\nby a 20700 li-ion battery and managed by a boost converter and charging module. The Raspberry Pi issued\nsignals according to a Python script. The script created a web server\nfor listening to post requests sent after a Git commit or push.\n<br /><br /> From our experiments, we found that commits increased by 500% while wearing the programming hat.\nWe conclude the fun effect of the hat incentivizes users to make more Github contributions. \nThe programming hat was voted best project by our classmates."
