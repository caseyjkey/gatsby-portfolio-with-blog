  "description": "My mom is a Native American artisan in a small rural mountain town in Wyoming. She loves making beaded lighter cases and we've already shared them with all our friends, so I decided to help her spread her work and earn more income by building a web store for her.<br /><br />\n\nMy goals were to create a boutique experience with her products at the center in a beautiful experience on both desktop and mobile, while keeping running costs low compared to using Shopify.<br /><br />\n\nFor inventory management, I used OpenCV to extract individual lighters from group photos (3×3 grids per picture), upscaled them using a GAN, and removed backgrounds using a model from Hugging Face. This automated the initial product image processing workflow.<br /><br />\n\nThe result is a fully functional e-commerce platform with Stripe payments, email notifications via Mailgun, and an intuitive Django admin console for managing products and orders—all at a fraction of the cost of hosted solutions.",
